Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, 
but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). 
Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only 
when more than one word is present.

Try with different constraints:
1. Using loops
2. Using method calls
