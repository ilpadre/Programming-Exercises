# Palindromish-20201216

## Write a program to find all 9-letter words where the middle three letters are 'E' 'L' 'I', and the last three letters are the same as the first three letters but in reverse.

### _ _ _ E L I _ _ _

For example, if the word "abcelicbe" was an actual English word, it would satisfy the condition.

The repo contains a large file of English words that you can use if you don't have a ready source of words to process.

## Enhancements

1. Remove the 9-letter restriction. Search for words of any length that meet the criteria.
2. Substitute a user-entered ‘middle three.’ In other words, ask the user to enter 3 letters and see if there is a word that matches.
3. Remove the restriction on the number of letters for the "middle three". In other words, ask the user to supply a pattern of any length and then search for words that contain that pattern and are enclosed within a palindrome.
